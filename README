== Welcome to base_app

base_app is a default Ruby on Rails project which by default includes the following:

 * A layout, including:
    - tabs
    - global links
    - optional sidebar
    - notice, warning and error flash messages
    - a very agreeable stylesheet
 * Default dashboard page
 * User authentication, with:
    - login form at /login
    - signup form at /signup
    - activation
 * Plugins:
    - restful_authentication
    - acts_as_state_machine
 * Frozen Rails 2.0.2

== Getting started

To get started quickly, do a search and replace on the following strings to personalize base_app. 

 "base_app" 		=> "My Cool Application Name"
 "base_app_url" 	=> "www.baseapp.com"			# Don't include http:// or a trailing slash
 "company_name" 	=> "My Company Name"

== To do's

There are still some things I want in base_app, but which haven't gotten around to implementing yet.

 * Add user roles (with default 'user' role for users, and a default administrator role)
 * Administration panel where you can:
    - Manage users (add, delete, purge, suspend, activate, send new passwords)
    - Manage roles / permissions
    - Manage settings for base_app
 * OpenID signup/login
 * Reset password option
 * User profiles
 * Configuration (e.g. from config/app.yml) (use activation? enable OpenID? etc.)
 * Use Gibberish and make the whole app available in English and Dutch by default
 * Add form helpers which allow easy form building (is a plugin available?)
 * Test the whole thing!

Feel free to implement any of these features and send in a patch. Other features are welcome also, but those will be judged on general usability.
