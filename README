== Welcome to base_app

base_app is a default Ruby on Rails project which by default includes the following:

 * A layout, including:
    - tabs
    - global links
    - optional sidebar
    - notice, warning and error flash messages
    - a very agreeable stylesheet
 * Default dashboard page
 * Administration panel where you can:
    - Manage users (add, delete, purge, suspend, activate, send new passwords)
    - Manage settings for base_app
 * User authentication, with:
    - login form at /login
    - signup form at /signup
    - password and login recovery
    - activation
 * Plugins:
    - restful_authentication
    - acts_as_state_machine
 * Frozen Rails 2.0.2

== Getting started

There are several things you'll need to do before you can really get started. Run the following rake command:

   rake notes:todo

This will generate a list of TODO entries throughout the project. Check the TODO entries in the code for more information.

Note: Todo's tagged with (base_app) are for the base_app project itself. You can safely ignore these.

== base_app To do's

There are still some things I want in base_app, but which haven't gotten around to implementing yet.

NOTE: Also run 'rake notes:todo'. Todo's tagged with (base_app) are also wanted features

 * Manage roles / permissions
 * OpenID signup/login
 * Configuration (e.g. from config/app.yml) (use activation? enable OpenID? etc.)
 * Use Gibberish and make the whole app available in English and Dutch by default
 * Add form helpers which allow easy form building (is a plugin available?)
 * Test the whole thing!

Feel free to implement any of these features and send in a patch. Other features are welcome also, but those will be judged on general usability.
